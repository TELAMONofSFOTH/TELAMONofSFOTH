***KEEP IN MIND:***<sub>(1) I'm a very VERBAL person once we are close! Please let me know if you're uncomfortable.   (2) Use *Tone Tags* if possible, I'm a Neurodivergent person!   (3) If I don't respond to you that's mostly because I'm doing something else.   (4) Usually I'm sticking to people I'm more comfortable with!</sub>
